// Given a list of integers, determine the start index of the sequence of 5 numbers
// whose sum is greatest
// Algorithm: Approach it like you're looking for the maximum in the array
// Start and index 0 and assume this results in the greatest subsequence
// Iterate through the array checking the subsequence for each index and update
// the start index if the a subsequence is found which results in a greater sum
